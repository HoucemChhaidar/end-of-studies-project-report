\subsection{Use Case Diagram}
Figure~\ref{fig:uc_sprint3} presents the three major use cases developed during Sprint 3: purchasing bulk credit, distributing credit across end users, and monitoring end user transactions. It illustrates their respective interactions with the \textit{Corporate} actor and the authentication system.

\subsection{Realization (Sprint 3)}

In this section, we present the main interfaces developed during Sprint 3, dedicated to credit management functionality. This work involved implementing bulk credit purchasing, credit distribution systems, and transaction monitoring capabilities. Each interface is illustrated with screenshots and accompanied by descriptions of functionality and user journey.

\subsubsection{Bulk credit purchase interface}

The bulk credit purchase interface guides corporate users through the credit purchasing process with email verification and admin approval.

\noindent\textbf{Credit Purchase Form:}

Figure \ref{fig:credit_purchase_form} illustrates the credit purchase form, the initial step of the bulk credit acquisition process.

%   \caption{Credit purchase form with amount selection}
%   \label{fig:credit_purchase_form}
% \end{figure}

— \textbf{States presented:}
\begin{itemize}[nosep,leftmargin=*,label=•]
  \item \textbf{Amount selection}  
    Corporate user selects desired credit amount with pricing display.
  \item \textbf{Payment method}  
    Selection of payment method and billing information.
  \item \textbf{Email verification}  
    System sends verification email for transaction security.
\end{itemize}

— \textbf{Credit purchase flow:}
\begin{itemize}[nosep,leftmargin=*,label=•]
  \item Corporate user is authenticated and accesses purchase form.
  \item User selects credit amount and confirms purchase details.
  \item System sends email verification for security confirmation.
  \item Upon email verification, transaction is sent to admin for approval.
  \item Admin processes payment and credits are added to corporate balance.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Credit distribution dashboard}

The credit distribution dashboard enables corporate users to allocate purchased credit across their end users (see Figure \ref{fig:credit_distribution}).

    Display of all end users within the corporate organization.
  \item \textbf{Credit allocation}  
    Input fields for specifying credit amounts per user.
  \item \textbf{Balance validation}  
    Real-time validation of sufficient corporate balance.
  \item \textbf{Distribution confirmation}  
    Summary and confirmation of credit distribution.
\end{itemize}

— \textbf{Credit distribution flow:}
\begin{itemize}[nosep,leftmargin=*,label=•]
  \item Corporate user accesses distribution dashboard.
  \item System displays list of end users and current balances.
  \item User specifies credit amounts for selected end users.
