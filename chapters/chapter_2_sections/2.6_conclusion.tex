This chapter provided a comprehensive analysis of the Credix payment system requirements and design foundations. We identified the key application actors - Corporate clients and End users - and their specific roles within the system ecosystem. The functional requirements were structured around our sprint-based development approach, emphasizing credit management capabilities and analytics features that form the core of Credix's value proposition.

We established the technological foundation with carefully selected tools including Flutter for mobile development, Angular for web interfaces, Spring Boot for backend services, and PostgreSQL for data persistence. The non-functional requirements ensure scalability, security, and performance standards necessary for a financial payment platform.

The global use case analysis revealed the comprehensive scope of Credix, showcasing the interconnected functionalities across four development sprints. From basic user management and wallet operations to advanced credit distribution and financial reporting, the use case diagram demonstrates how authentication serves as the foundation for all system interactions.

The next chapter will focus on the detailed design and implementation of Release 1, covering the initial sprints that establish the core infrastructure and basic functionalities of the Credix platform.
