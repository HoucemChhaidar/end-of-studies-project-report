This chapter allowed us to specify in detail the requirements of the Credix application, both functional and non-functional. We presented and justified our technological choices, before detailing the chosen client-server architecture and its different layers. Finally, we described the CI/CD pipeline dedicated to the back-end and front-end, ensuring automated, rapid, and reliable deployment. The next chapter will be dedicated to the precise design of the components and the UML modeling of Credix.
