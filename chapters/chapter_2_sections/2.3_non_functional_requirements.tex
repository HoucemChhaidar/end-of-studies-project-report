\section{Non-functional Requirements}

Non-functional requirements define the quality, performance, and security constraints of the system. They ensure the robustness, efficiency, and usability of Credix.

\subsection{Security}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Encryption of sensitive data (JWT tokens, user credentials, transaction details, and any stored media).
    \item Protection against common web vulnerabilities (e.g., Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF), SQL/NoSQL injection).
    \item Implementation of comprehensive security logs and a robust logging system for critical actions and system events.
    \item Secure API endpoints with proper authentication and authorization mechanisms.
    \item Data anonymization or pseudonymization for sensitive user information where applicable.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Performance and Scalability}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Ensure an average API response time of less than 500 ms for at least 95\% of user requests, especially critical for real-time payment validation during peak retail hours.
    \item Implement caching mechanisms for frequently accessed static data (e.g., vendor lists, product categories) to reduce server load and improve response times.
    \item The system must be capable of handling a high volume of concurrent transactions, scaling horizontally to accommodate future growth in users and vendors.
    \item Optimize database queries and backend processes to ensure efficient data retrieval and processing.
    \item Implement offline capabilities for the mobile application (caching last 10 transactions) and POS (storing pending transactions with exponential backoff retry) to ensure service continuity in areas with unstable internet connectivity.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Maintainability and Testing}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Code structured into well-defined modules (front-end, back-end, shared services, API integration layer) to facilitate understanding and future modifications.
    \item Achieve a unit test coverage of over 80 \% for critical business logic and core functionalities.
    \item Provide comprehensive API documentation (e.g., using Swagger/OpenAPI) and detailed deployment guides to ensure ease of maintenance and onboarding for new developers.
    \item Implement automated integration and end-to-end tests to ensure the seamless interaction between different system components, including ASM POS integration.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Usability (UX/UI)}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Develop a clear, accessible, and responsive interface that adapts seamlessly across various mobile devices (smartphones, tablets) and POS terminals.
    \item Adhere to established ergonomic standards, ensuring intuitive navigation, minimal cognitive load, and a consistent user experience across all modules.
    \item Utilize a modern and professional design aesthetic, with fluid transitions and interactions between different application sections, enhancing user satisfaction for End-Users, Vendors, and Corporate Clients.
    \item Provide clear feedback mechanisms for user actions, such as payment confirmations and error messages.
\end{itemize}
