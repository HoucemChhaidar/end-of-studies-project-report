\section{Functional Requirements}

Functional requirements describe the set of services and interactions that the system must provide to satisfy the users of Credix. They are categorized along several major axes: user and account management, payment flow management, transaction and usage monitoring, notifications and alerts, wallet and balance management, and dashboard and reporting.

\subsection{User and Account Management}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Creation, modification, and logical deletion of accounts (End-User, Vendor, Corporate, Administrator).
    \item Secure authentication (email/password, JWT, token refresh, biometric authentication for End-Users).
    \item Management of roles and permissions according to user type.
    \item Corporate account creation, modification, and management.
    \item Employee account management within corporate structures (addition, removal, status tracking).
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Payment Flow Management}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Generation of unique, time-bound (e.g., 30-second expiry) 1D barcodes (e.g., Code128 format) linked to the End-User's tokenized wallet ID.
    \item Real-time validation of barcode payments by the Spring Boot backend upon scanning by ASM POS terminals.
    \item Processing of payment transactions, including debiting the End-User's wallet and crediting the Vendor's account.
    \item Implementation of fraud detection rules (e.g., >5 transactions/min from one user) to block suspicious payments.
    \item Requirement of SMS One-Time Password (OTP) for payments exceeding a predefined threshold (e.g., 200 TND).
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Transaction and Usage Monitoring}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Recording and display of all payment transactions for End-Users (date, time, vendor, amount, status).
    \item Tracking of credit allocation and usage for Corporate Clients (distributed amount, consumed amount, remaining balance).
    \item Monitoring of payment settlements and transaction summaries for Vendors.
    \item Real-time updates on transaction status (pending, completed, failed).
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Notifications and Alerts}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Instant push notifications for End-Users upon successful payment, credit updates, or security alerts.
    \item Real-time alerts for Corporate Clients on credit depletion, suspicious activity, or policy violations.
    \item Notifications for Vendors on successful payment receipt and daily settlement summaries.
    \item System alerts for Administrators on fraud attempts, system errors, or critical events.
\item Multi-language support for notifications (English, French, Arabic).
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Wallet and Balance Management}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Display of current digital wallet balance for End-Users.
    \item Management of corporate credit pools, including bulk purchase and top-up functionalities.
    \item Allocation and de-allocation of credit to individual employees by Corporate Clients.
    \item Enforcement of corporate-defined spending limits (e.g., monthly limits, daily limits) and expiry settings.
    \item Secure tokenization of wallet IDs for enhanced security.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Dashboard and Reporting}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Graphical visualization of key metrics for Corporate Clients (e.g., credit consumption trends, employee spending patterns).
    \item Generation of customizable reports for Corporate Clients (e.g., credit allocation reports, detailed usage reports) in PDF/CSV formats.
    \item Vendor dashboard displaying daily transaction summaries, settlement status, and payment history.
    \item Administrator dashboard for real-time system monitoring, fraud alerts, and user activity logs.
    \item Dynamic filters for reports (e.g., period, user, vendor, transaction type).
\end{itemize}
