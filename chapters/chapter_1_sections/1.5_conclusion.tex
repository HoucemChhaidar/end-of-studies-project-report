This first chapter established the foundational framework of the Credix project by presenting the host organization, ASM, its sectors of activity, as well as the challenges related to digital financial transaction management and the analysis of existing solutions. This preparatory phase enabled us to define a solid methodological and organizational foundation, taking into account the technical constraints, functional objectives, and Agile best practices.
Chapter 2 will present the functional, non-functional, and technical requirements of Credix, before detailing the chosen architecture and the rationale behind the key technological decisions made for its implementation.
