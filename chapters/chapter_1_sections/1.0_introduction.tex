The objective of this first chapter is to present the general context in which our project—an integrated Point of Sale (POS) system developed using Flutter and Spring Boot—was conceived and carried out. We begin with a brief overview of the host organization, ASM, a Tunisian company whose operational needs motivated the creation of this solution.

Next, we examine the current tools and methods employed in similar retail environments, highlighting their limitations and the recurring challenges reported by users. This analysis serves to justify the need for a new, tailored platform.

Following this comparative study, we present the proposed solution in detail, emphasizing its key features, its added value, and how it responds directly to the specific needs of ASM. Finally, we outline the project methodology adopted throughout the development cycle, shedding light on the stages that led to the final implementation of the system.
